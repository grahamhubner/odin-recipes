        <ul>
            <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed in a press</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 3-inch cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pineapple juice</li>
            <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except cornstarch and chicken. 
                Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and stir until sugar is 
                dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. 
                Discard cinnamon stick and mix in ½ cup water.      
            </li>
            <li>Place chicken in a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. Add soy sauce mixture, 
                seal bag, and turn to coat chicken. Refrigerate for at least an hour, 
                ideally overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Remove chicken and set aside. Pour mixture into a small saucepan. 
                Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low. Mix cornstarch with 2 
                tablespoons water and add to pan. Stir until mixture begins to thicken, 
                and gradually stir in enough water (about ½ cup) until sauce is the consistency 
                of heavy cream. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
